- make lyricsd (could be managed from fake-lyricsd???! (displayibg the status of lyricsd and a "switch" to toggle the background ops (maybe even change the period of time between checks)))
- add filter options for artist and song names, so fe BT gets recognised (sed??)

- replace the exit button with an autoclose switch, that triggers the lyticsd to close or not if the song ends (or put the switch elsewhere idk)
