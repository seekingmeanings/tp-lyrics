- file_reader doesn't when reading small files

- make lyricsd (could be managed from fake-lyricsd???! (displayibg the status of lyricsd and a "switch" to toggle the background ops (maybe even change the period of time between checks)))

- replace the exit button with an autoclose switch, that triggers the lyticsd to close or not if the song ends (or put the switch elsewhere idk)

- fix a timeout bug that occures with bad internet connections
- find the problem of the bug because it's not in my code :)	[maybe]

- terminal mode
